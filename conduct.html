                     <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="text-align:center"><b> Suggestions and Guidelines for Safety in a Virtual Reality or Augmented Reality HMD during public demos: </b>

                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="text-align:justify">Since someone in any kind of Head Mounted Device has limited to completely obscured vision, it is important to recognize appropriate behavior around them. If you are not the person actively assisting with the demo: <br> <br><ul>
                      <li> Please stay a minimum of 3 feet away from any person using an HMD, for both your own safety and theirs. </li>
                      <li> Do not touch the person in the HMD, with the exception of preventing imminent harm (e.g. they are about to fall) </li>
                      <li> Recognize that leaving Virtual or Augmented reality can be disorienting for some, and allow people adequate time to adjust. </li></ul><br><br>

                    If you are someone actively assisting with a demo, recognize that safety is the first concern. <br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Consider providing a seated experience when possible.</li>
                    <li> Before handing the user any equipment, explain what you are going to do, and what they are likely to experience. </li>
                    <li> Give users a safe place to put belongings temporarily while they are demoing. </li>
                    <li> If content is of a sexual or extremely graphically violent nature, warn the participant, and use your best judgment when the participant is under 18. </li>
                    <li> If your content has in intense discomfort level <a href="https://support.oculus.com/help/oculus/918058048293446/")> (https://support.oculus.com/help/oculus/918058048293446/)</a> warn the participant, and offer solutions for if they start to feel nauseous (e.g. “Close your eyes if you feel ill”)</li>
                    <li> When starting the demo, verbally narrate your actions as you help the participant put on any equipment (e.g. “I’m going to put the headset on you now” and “Here are the headphones/controllers”) </li>
                    <li> Ensure sufficient clearance around the participant, and offer any appropriate safety warnings (e.g. cables, walls) </li>
                    <li> When possible, at crowded events, use tables or other physical barriers to separate the demo space from the general public area.</li>
                    <li> Use covers for HMD foam, and disinfect using alcohol wipes between each user.</li>
                    <li> If necessary to touch the participant to move them, narrate your actions, and only touch the participant on the shoulders. (“I’m going to move you a step to your left”)</li>
                    <li> Monitor the surroundings of the user for the entirety of the demo to ensure physical safety, and prevent damage of your equipment.</li>
                    <li> Recognize that leaving Virtual or Augmented reality can be disorienting for some, and allow people as much time as they need to recover before leaving your demo area.</li></ul><br><br>

                    If you are the person in the HMD: <br><br>
                    <ul>
                    <li> Respect the person giving you the demo, and their equipment. </li>
                    <li> Follow all guidelines they give you - they want you to have a safe and great experience. </li>
                    <li> Be aware of your surroundings prior to entering - especially how close physical objects like walls and furniture are to you. </li>
                    <li> Don’t use other people’s equipment if you are sick, especially if you are suffering from an upper respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, or any other highly contagious disease </li>
                    <li> If you start to feel nausea or other symptoms related to being in virtual reality, close your eyes, or remove the HMD.</li>
                    <li> At the end of a demo, remove equipment carefully, or wait for the person giving you the demo to do so.</li>
                    <li> If you feel someone touched you inappropriately while you engaged in the experience, report this as soon as possible to the leadership team for the event.</li></ul>

                     <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="text-align:center;"><b>  Reporting & Consequences </b>
                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="text-align:justify"> ARVR Academy will not act on complaints regarding: <br><br>    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.” </li>
                        <li> Communicating in a 'tone' you don't find congenial. </li>
                        <li> Criticizing or commenting on racist, sexist, or otherwise oppresive behaviors </li>
                    </ul>

If you are being harassed by a member of ARVR Academy, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the leadership team at arvracademy@gmail.com. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can. <br><br>

This code of conduct applies to ARVR Academy spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of ARVR Academy outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by ARVR Academy members, especially the leadership team, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from ARVR Academy based on their past behavior, including behavior outside ARVR Academy spaces and behavior towards people who are not in ARVR Academy. <br><br>

In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response. <br><br>

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of ARVR Academy members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent. <br><br>

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the leadership team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all ARVR Academy spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other ARVR Academy members or the general public.
