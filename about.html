                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted" style="text-align:justify">The ARVR Academy grew out of two things - our love for AR and VR and the potential these technologies
                        have to change the world, and our understanding that the tech industry, as it exists, is simply not
                        diverse. This is a problem recognized by many, but solved by few. We resolved to be part of the solution
                        at the very beginning of this rapidly expanding industry. <br><br> One of the major problems that
                        existing tech companies have in pursuing diversity is that they are already established - they already
                        have many employees, and it’s not a simple problem to suddenly replace half of those employees with
                        women or other minorities. They already have an existing culture in place, that perhaps may be difficult
                        to change to be more welcoming to people of diverse backgrounds. That’s the reason that we’re pursuing
                        diversity in AR and VR now - because it’s much easier to start as you mean to go on.
                        <br><br> That’s only part of the solution though. Obviously, you need qualified candidates to help
                        build out your business. We need diverse founders starting the next big companies in VR or AR. In
                        order to empower people to pursue their passions and dreams, they need a foundation of knowledge,
                        a supportive network, and access to mentors and resources that will help them succeed.
                        <br><br> That’s where we come in.
                        <br>
                        <br> ARVR Academy is a nonprofit dedicated to diversity and inclusion in AR and VR through education
                        and professional development efforts to make the ARVR industry more accessible to people of all backgrounds.
                        <br><br> We have developed an educational curriculum that can be used by anyone worldwide to teach
                        basic VR and AR development skills to anyone. We only ask that this course is taught to students
                        from all backgrounds, with a minimum of 50/50 gender balance, and that it is taught on a non-profit
                        basis. We provide support and guidance to instructors around the world, as well as running these
                        classes locally in San Francisco and Silicon Valley.
                        <br>
                        <br> We organize regular educational talks with professional women and people of underrepresented
                        communities from all over the VR and AR industry, increasing the visibility and access to role models
                        who are making a difference in their industry. Additionally, we work with VR and AR tech conference
                        organizers to help them identify relevant speakers for events from varying backgrounds and demographics.
